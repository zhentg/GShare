# PyMOL All in one

Many researchers want to use PyMOL under Windows. Fortunately, there are precompiled PyMOL binary files available(https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/). And there are many PyMOL plug-ins (https://github.com/Pymol-Scripts/Pymol-script-repo) available too.

However, installation of PyMOL and its plug-ins is not trivial. On Windows, some of the key plug-ins can not work without modifications.

I tried to combine some of the plug-ins with PyMOL, wrote a Windows batch file to setup the environment variables, and 
pack them into one 7zip file. With this 7zip file, user will have a powerful SBDD platform based on PyMOL 2.1 on Windows.

##    Installation
        Based on the step by step installed packages, Zhenting Gao packed all the file into a package zip file <#ID_20289699>
        Unzip the package to a folder
            解压缩的目录名称不要包含空格或特殊字符
        Click to run the batch file install.bat
        Allow the reg.exe to modify the environment variables in needed
            o
        Reboot the computer

###        Docking
            limitations
                torsion angle of aromatic amine is rotatable
                    o
                        EED226 as an example
            Feature
                water can be included as part of receptor
                Both AutoDock and AutoDock Vina can be used for docking
            Workflow
                change directory
                    In the External GUI
                        pwd
                        cd 
                select protein and ligand
                    name string should not contain
                        space
                        underline
                set grid
                prepare protein
                    amino acid protonation state should be set manually by PyMOL "Builder" mode
                prepare ligand
                    ligand protonation state and bond order should be set manually by PyMOL "Builder" mode
                    for compound with unknown binding pose, the 3D conformation should be correctly prepared with RDkit
                        OpenBabel can generate 3D conformation, but may not be correct for uncommon structures

                In the External GUI
                    pwd
                    cd 
            prepare structure
                remove unwanted ligands and protein chains
                    enable "Sequence mode"
                        scroll to the residues to remove
                            right click

                Local optimization
                    default parameter is not enough to get a local minima

                Global optimization
                    default parameter needs quite some time to calculate
                    tangible parameter
